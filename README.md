# Conflux-HDMI
Conflux-HDMI is an easy to use API that provides hardware abstraction for internal HDMI kits for the original Xbox. It allows for a single developer-facing interface to interact and configure these devices.

#### Documentation
All of the developer-facing API is documented, as well as most of the backend. All documentation is available in the "Docs" directory. If you notice any issues with the documentation, please let me know and I will make sure it gets resolved.

#### Examples
Inside the "Examples" directory, there are multiple examples showing how simple Conflux-HDMI is to integrate into existing applications, as well as providing sample code showing how to interact with the API. There is no need to worry about what HDMI implementation you are interacting with, only what configurable features it exposes.

#### Supported Devices
Currently the only supported HDMI device is the XboxHDMI kit from MakeMHz. If any other hardware developers would like to leverage this API, please reach out to me and I can help support your integration.
